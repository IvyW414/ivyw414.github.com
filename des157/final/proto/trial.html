        <h2>Game Design UX Best Practices</h2>
        <h3>By Amir Dori</h3>  

        <p>The article shares with the reader how to implement design to its best performance in order to enhance a user’s gaming experience based on proven data. Not only is the user’s gaming experience focused, the efficient actions that lead to monetization are also emphasized. A notable best practice that caught my attention is to avoid the “X” button altogether for pop ups and use the “Close” button instead. Users are usually impatient and will instantly close the pop up content without even looking at the content if there is an “X” button. Thus, using buttons like the “Close” or “Cancel” button will increase the probability that users will read the content.</p>
        <p>Another interesting design pattern to implement in game design is the consistency of positioning positive user decision on the right and negative user decision on the left. This functions best when paired with a consistent color. For instance, green is for positive user interaction and red for negative. Consistency in design is important for users get used to something, which will help increase their user experience. Sliders are a great design choice to utilize if there are more content to offer than what is allowed to be displayed on screen. There are several informative practices offered in this article.</p>

        <h2>Every Picture: Visual Thinking</h2>
        <h3 id="space">Image Analysis</h3>  

     
        <img src="images/umbrella.jpg" width="250">
        <figcaption>Ivy Wang: Grasse, Italy.</figcaption>
        <p id="first">This image is interesting because of the angle it was shot at and the repetition of pink umbrellas. The image is a low angle shot and did not capture any ground view. There are no people, no street floor, and no building doors in sight. Since there are no unorganized movements in the photo, it makes the setting appear calm and silent. The focus is on the umbrellas and the architecture. The umbrellas appear to float amidst the sky because the string that they are hanging onto is not visible in the photo. Instead of humans, I view the umbrellas as characters floating down the tight alley street. The tall structure of the buildings and the sleek elegant architecture produce a Harry Potter vibe. A mysterious, but soothing ambience is created from the symmetrically hanged umbrellas. The places I visited last summer in Europe is my choice of topic for my image collection. This image relates to the topic because it is a shot of a busy street located in Grasse, France that I visited last summer. My collection conveys to the viewer that I enjoy travelling and am a nostalgic person because I like to capture prominent memories of my travels.</p>
        
       
        <img src="images/cassette.jpg" width="250">
        <figcaption>Rochelle Meichen Dai :cassette tape</figcaption>
        <p>This image is about a product that a person is holding with three fingers. The product is a cassette tape that is produced and available for purchase in the market through mass-production. The text on the cassette tape is in Chinese characters and the fogginess of the clear plastic indicates that the cassette is quite old. The tone of the colors (blue, yellow, green, and pink) are quite saturated and the design of the title page is basic. I notice a repeated wave pattern that serves as the background of the cassette tape. The most interesting aspect of this image is that it conveys to me time and history. The cassette tape looks worn down and the product itself is not popular today. However, it was a popular item in the past for people to listen to recorded audio. The historical value of the object is mysterious and for those that cannot read Chinese characters, the content of the cassette tape is equally mysterious. The hand and the rectangular shape of the object are the most obvious aspects of the photo.</p>
