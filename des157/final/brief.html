        <h2>Project Summary</h2>

        <p>For my final project, I plan to iterate the design of my Every Picture studio about my travels and further develop it by adding in more complex interactions within a modern interface design.</p>

        <h2>Comparison Project 1</h2>

        <p>This website (<a href="https://maxilla.jp/en">link to website</a>) serves as a portfolio for the Maxilla company in Japan and displays the works of the company. I feel like the interface design appears appealing to young adults because of the modern black and white aesthetic paired with a chic presentation of information. I enjoy the smooth scroll interaction with the content of the website and the comfortably timed easing motion of the images. The minimalistic interface design of the home page is especially eye catching to me. I like the circular content display and interaction, where when scrolled up and down, different projects are revealed in a circular motion. The user can click on a specific project and they will be taken to a new page. Personally, I feel like the website’s dark color palette is overused because every page of the website uses a black background color, which makes the website appear slightly dull. Perhaps incorporating more colors or some grayscale will improve the dullness. Overall, this is a beautifully constructed website.</p>

        <h2>Comparison Project 2</h2>

        <p>This website (<a href="https://2020.milkshake.studio">link to website</a>) acts like an online newspaper that sums up major events in the year 2020 and presents the information in a creative way. The website’s interaction design focuses on the scrolling feature to display new information. It has a complex interface design where text, images, and colors interact with each other as the user scrolls up and down. There are a variety of different styles implemented into the interface design. I especially like the stacked layout of  the images and how it is placed at the center and displayed in a consecutive manner as the user scrolls down. I think the scrolling feature is working well for this website. However, the content of the page is too large and causes the website to run slow. Perhaps reducing the size of the images will help the website run smoother. Overall, it is a fun website to explore.</p>

        <h2>Project Goals</h2>

        <p>For my final project, I want to iterate the original interface design into a more modern aesthetic and incorporate stronger colors and typefaces. I will include a larger selection of images divided in respective to the different travel locations. I hope to either implement a timed scrolling or a scrolling interaction of my sets of travel images that is similar to the method showcased on the home page of the Maxilla website. However, instead of a circular scroll, I plan to produce a vertical scroll. The images will be placed in the vertical scroll with an appearance similar to a film roll. When I click on a specific set of images on the home page, I will be taken to a new page that will display a detailed description of the images. In the new page, I want to have the images stacked in a similar style to the newspaper website. Different from the newspaper website, I want to incorporate timed elements to the stacked images.</p>

        <h2>Design Strategies</h2>

        <p>In order to produce a modern aesthetic, I plan to use sans serif fonts such as Helvetica in both bold and thin strokes to add depth. My color palette will include bright saturated colors such as orange, green, and blue, as well as light pastel colors. The saturated colors will be used to highlight important sections of information or as borders of images and title texts. To keep the design consistent, the different pages of the sets of images will have a similar layout design. The home page will have a different layout design, where the main content is placed on the middle of the page whilst other pages have contents both on the left and right side. The travel images I choose will be of high quality taken from a camera. Aside from the modern aesthetics, a film roll theme will be incorporated throughout the website. I want the website to be a mix of the common modern aesthetic paired with film characteristics.</p>

        <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>

        <p>My final project will have time-based behaviors, visual feedbacks, and scroll interactions. Time-based behaviors will be featured on multiple secondary pages of the website, which displays the content of a set of images at a specific location.  The time-based behavior will be initiated a second after the page loads or through a click of the mouse. When initiated, the stack of images will scroll slowly. When the mouse hovers over the stack of images, the scrolling motion will decrease for users to view the image/caption. The home page will have a scroll interaction, scrolling up and down depending on the direction of the mouse. Visual feedback such as the appearance of a colored border will appear when the mouse hovers over a specific selection of images/texts.</p>

        <h2>Experience Goals</h2>

        <p>The intended goal of my final project is for my audience to have a relaxing and enjoyable time exploring the content of my website. I will use high quality photos to produce aesthetic visuals. The interactions within the website should not be confusing, nor should it create a headache when navigating through the different pages.Therefore, the interaction design needs to be straightforward to the user. To make sure the interactions are not confusing and are useful, I will stray away from including unnecessary interactions. Visual cues such as text stating “scroll” will be inputted when necessary. The main focus of my website are the travel images that are associated with a specific location. To keep the different sets of images apart, I will place them in sections by separating them through the use of different colored borders. Minimal captions will be used in order to keep the audience’s focus on the images.</p>
