        <h2>Every Picture: Sonia Presne</h2>
        <h3>Website by Sonia Presne</h3>  

        <p>Sonia Presne is a senior art director and his portfolio website showcases images and interaction in a creative way that sparked my interest (<a href="https://soniapresne.com">link to website</a>). When the website first loads, the viewer sees an elegantly styled text that states what the website is about. Then in around two seconds, several images appear at the center of the page and stacks on top of each other. Once all the images are stacked, they quickly flow to the right so that each image is presented on its own. By scrolling up and down, users can control the left and right movement of the images and click on a specific image that catches their attention. The speed of the scrolling feels just right and looks smooth on screen. </p>
        <p>When an image is centered, the title of the art work appears at the center bottom of the page. There is a slight ripple movement on the images and when the mouse hovers over a specific image, the movement of the ripple increases to indicate the user that they are selecting that specific image. This visual cue is helpful to notify users what they are about to click on. When an image is clicked, it enlarges and covers the entire screen, loading the new page in an undistracting method. I feel like the website successfully combined the user interaction with the images in an effortless way. The images chosen are interesting and sparks user curiosity. The interaction and movement in the website flows smoothly and supports the content of the page rather than distracting. </p>

        <h2>Best Practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows</h2>
        <h3>By Naema Baskanderi</h3>

        <p>The article compared modal windows to popup windows and shared that the incorrect usage of the modal window pushed users to instinctively close the modal. However, if a modal is executed with the correct and necessary features, it will improve the layout and user experience with the interface. Modals are used to grab the user’s attention, for user input, and to show additional information. It purposely interrupts the user from their current task to complete a more important task. The article shared several tips that help designers incorporate the modal successfully to the parent webpage. For instance, a modal window should be user initiated, where the modal appears as a result of clicking a button or pressing a key on the keyboard. It is important that the anatomy of the modal includes the following elements: straightforward information, a descriptive title, a close button, button label to initiate action, and appropriate sizing/location of the modal window. Modals are not advised to be used on mobile devices due to the small screen size. This article provided a plentiful amount of useful information on implementing the modal to the best of its usability to enhance user experience. </p>

        <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
        <h3>By Salim Ansari</h3>

        <p>This article offered tips for better and more efficient form design, providing suggestions on how to improve a form’s user experience (UX). The main takeaway I grasped from the tips shared in the article is the benefits of simple and straightforward visual cues. It is important to remember that oftentimes, less is more. Simplicity is favored over complex layout in form design that hopes to provide a good user experience. A straightforward visual layout such as the one column layout makes the process of filling out a form faster and easier. The spacing of a layout is equally important. Appropriate sizing of each field of question makes it less confusing for the user. For instance, the field sizing of the width asking for the zip code should be smaller than the address line. The article emphasizes the importance of omitting unnecessary questions and to get straight to the point. Form design that is visually clean in layout and hierarchy produces a better user experience.</p>
