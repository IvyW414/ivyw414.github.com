        <h2>Best Practices for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows</h2>
        <h3>By Naema Baskanderi</h3>

        <p>The article compared modal windows to popup windows and shared that the incorrect usage of the modal window pushed users to instinctively close the modal. However, if a modal is executed with the correct and necessary features, it will improve the layout and user experience with the interface. Modals are used to grab the user’s attention, for user input, and to show additional information. It purposely interrupts the user from their current task to complete a more important task. The article shared several tips that help designers incorporate the modal successfully to the parent webpage. For instance, a modal window should be user initiated, where the modal appears as a result of clicking a button or pressing a key on the keyboard. It is important that the anatomy of the modal includes the following elements: straightforward information, a descriptive title, a close button, button label to initiate action, and appropriate sizing/location of the modal window. Modals are not advised to be used on mobile devices due to the small screen size. This article provided a plentiful amount of useful information on implementing the modal to the best of its usability to enhance user experience. </p>

        <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
        <h3>By Salim Ansari</h3>

        <p>This article offered tips for better and more efficient form design, providing suggestions on how to improve a form’s user experience (UX). The main takeaway I grasped from the tips shared in the article is the benefits of simple and straightforward visual cues. It is important to remember that oftentimes, less is more. Simplicity is favored over complex layout in form design that hopes to provide a good user experience. A straightforward visual layout such as the one column layout makes the process of filling out a form faster and easier. The spacing of a layout is equally important. Appropriate sizing of each field of question makes it less confusing for the user. For instance, the field sizing of the width asking for the zip code should be smaller than the address line. The article emphasizes the importance of omitting unnecessary questions and to get straight to the point. Form design that is visually clean in layout and hierarchy produces a better user experience.</p>
